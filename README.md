# Machine Learning Assignment 1

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my machine learning assignment 1. The task involves building a model to classify toxic comments, and I have made several modifications to the starter code to enhance its performance.

## Files and Directory Structure

- **`code/`**: This directory contains the main Python script or Jupyter notebook for the machine learning model.
  - `your_main_code.py` or `your_notebook.ipynb`: The primary code file for the assignment.

- **`data/`**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing.
  - `toxiccomments_train.csv`: The training dataset.
  - `toxiccomments_test.csv`: The test dataset.

- **`results/`**: This directory may contain any output files, logs, or results generated by your code.

- **`README.md`**: This file that you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.). You can include a `requirements.txt` file if necessary.

## How to Run
1. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
2. Navigate to the `code/` directory:
3. Run the main script or notebook:
